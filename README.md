# connect_four

This is a part of The Odin Project's Ruby course. 

I utilized a graph with nodes to create the board. I had added some methods to connect all the vertices with their neighbors, thinking it would be useful to determine win conditions but this did not end up being used. I left this neighbor code (and tests) in just as a reference.

To play you must have ruby installed, then navigate to the game folder.

Inside the folder install colorize with the following command: gem install colorize

Then type: ruby lib/game_connect_four.rb to start the game
